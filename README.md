# weather-app-TOP-Project

Well, it was a glorious adventure. I really wanted to do exactly the weather application. It took some time. Probably because I wanted to show a lot of information.

What was done:

1. Search engine by city name. The search results contain minimal data about cities.
2. Change of calculation systems. Metric and imperial. The application remembers the choice.
3. Informative weather panel. Weather schedule by hours and days.
4. After the first search, the application remembers the city you selected and next time open the last city you selected.
5. The site works great in a phone browser. The site adaptively works with different displays.

What I have learned:

1. Of course, I was interested in working with the API. It's not difficult, but this project taught me how to work with them.
2. I got to know better npm + Webpack and try to constantly work with him. This time I used a small framework.
3. I read about the principles of OOP, but I still do not fully understand how to implement them correctly. I first wrote all the code in one file, and then destructured it into components that I placed in separate files. The main file index.js still looks big enough.
4. Continued to improve in HTML and CSS. Everything was written in pure HTML and CSS without copying parts of the code from other sources.

What is still missing:

1. Design. It is very minimalistic, which, on the one hand, is not bad, but on the other hand, the site looks raw and unfinished. I did most of the functional part.
2. I wanted to make a dynamic picture from behind. But something went wrong. Maybe I'll do it in the future.

   17.07.2022 - The site is working. There is support for different displays. Saving the number system and the last selected city.<br>
   16.09.2022 - Add Ukrainian Language.
